The fundamental difference revolves around where the upgrade logic is implemented and managed. 

In the Transparent model, a separate entity manages upgrades, providing a robust separation between regular contract interactions and administrative actions. 

Conversely, the UUPS pattern centralizes this logic within the implementation contract itself, offering a streamlined approach that embeds upgradeability directly into the contract's core logic.
